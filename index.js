// IPv4 Validator
// Given a string, determine if it is a valid IPv4 Address. A valid IPv4 address consists of four integer numbers separated by dots (.). Each number must satisfy the following conditions:

// It is between 0 and 255 inclusive.
// It does not have leading zeros (e.g. 0 is allowed, 01 is not).
// Only numeric characters are allowed.

function isValidIPv4(ipv4) {
  console.log(ipv4);
  // between 0 - 255
  // NO leading 0s (!01)
  // only numeric
  // regex
  const regex = /[0-255+]\.[0-255+]\.[0-255+]\.[0-255+]/;
  console.log(regex.test(ipv4));
  return ipv4;
}
